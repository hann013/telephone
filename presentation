Overview of Game
    - Emmi: Meeting new classmates online, we all really enjoy using SnapChat and Yo, the quick delivery and disappearing of the content is very appealing to our generation. A game  from our childhood that had a similar type of ephemerality is the game “Telephone”

    - Hannah: Who has played the game "Telephone" before? Raise your hand. "Telephone" is a game where you gather with a group of friends and try to pass along a message from person to person.

    - Kristen: We've teamed up to bring you an interactive game that tests your memory and allows you to communicate with both old and new friends? So we're going to demo...-- what message should we send?

Challenges
    - Emmi: Problems with code outrunning Datastore

    - Hannah: Using AJAX and JSON to auto-refresh and redirect - connecting users via asynchronous communication between the server and browser
