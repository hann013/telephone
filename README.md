Telephone
=========
This is an interactive web game that was created over three days as our final project for
Google Computer Science Summer Institute 2014.

Telephone takes the traditional, in-person game of "Telephone"/"Broken Telephone", digitalizing it into a communication tool
that can be shared between friends and srangers alike.

The game was created using JavaScript and Python. In particular, JavaScript AJAX was used to allow communication between 
the server and each individual computer (of players during the game). This allows for real-time communication of one user's
interaction in the game to every other player, a key component of our game. 

Telephone was launched using Google AppEngine, and all data is stored in and retrieved from an AppEngine datastore. The website itself was designed with HTML and CSS.
